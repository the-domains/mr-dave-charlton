# Welcome

# 

My name is Dave Charlton. I'm a Musician, Photographer & Designer from Peterborough, UK. I recently graduated from Norwich University of the Arts studying Graphic Design and now work as the Music Production Assistant for my local church, KingsGate Community Church.

I'm still unsure as to the purpose of this site so for the time being here's a frame I took a while back using my film camera. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e29b5500-bc41-4d45-9f31-dbec11ac7457.JPG)
